  <h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Hi and welcome to Chirrups. This is basically a website built upon the resulting application from following Michael Hartl's tutorial at http://railstutorial.org/book.</p>

<h3>What's been added?</h3>
<p>On chapter 12 of the said tutorial, Mike listed possible extensions to the application, which a follower can work on. He said, "implementing one or more of these application extensions will help you make the transition from following a tutorial to writing original applications of your own."</p>

<p>Here's what's been added so far. I'm currently working on the last three extensions.

<ul>
	<li>Replies</li>
	<li>Messaging</li>
	<li>Follower notifications</li>
	<li>Password reminders</li>
	<li>Signup confirmation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Show me the codes!</h3>
<p>If you came here to see how far this application has gone from the original version, I've listed instructions on the help page to help you in your endeavor. If you're here besides that, why not sign up ?</p>
